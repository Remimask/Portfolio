## Behold, the dramatically constructed chaos I call my home website!

With HTML code having more comments of some stupid shit / thoughts of mine than actual code, CSS being a complete catastrophy and JavaScript being ~~copied code~~ re-used & borrowed script of fellow mentals...
You witness the best represantion of myself through a format of code.
<sup>Now please mind that all this is said witht a sick sense of humor.</sup>

The home website is completely built by myself using no frameworks to ease the process, which includes all the art <sup>(as for now, absolutely no art is even there)<sup> is done by me. 
This acts as my first part of the entirety of what I consider 'My personal portfolio'. The secondary, which will then be more of a gallery than a tour of my skills, will be accessible through this website. Now in an optimal, happy world
I would sometimes update this website with more stuff, fix old stuff or add more to flex with, but in all likelyhood this will sit as a token of my past once I am done with this. However, my goal is to polish it to perfection regardless.

## Why do I not use frameworks like React?

<sup>~~I'm a stubborn asshole that's why~~</sup>

I wanted to show off some of my more raw skills, knowing how to hanfdle problems without a base that makes the process easier.
_And all veteran programmers screamed in horror, in unison_ 
I am perfectly capable of using Frameworks, and that is exactly what I (might, have not decided this yet) will do in my secondary portfolio. Though by that point, I have a lot more skills to show off, proving my knoweldge 
of frameworks may be futile. However, it does not matter. I adapt my style and my work based on my challenges and projects.

Now sincerely, I hope I didn't spook off any of you with my crude words. I simply don't like lying by saying some general stuff like 'yees yes aye, I know it all and I'm the best you'll find blah blah blaahhrrfghgh'
Have a (sincerely) good day/night, wherever you are! :)
